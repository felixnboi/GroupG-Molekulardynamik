    1.clone the repository 
    2.mkdir build in the repo
    3.cd build
    4.Execute the executable with: "Usage: ./MolSim <path/to/input/file> [[end_time delta_t] | [end_time delta_t start_time]]".

Please make sure to pass numerical values to end_time delta_t and start_time. Also pay attention to the order of the arguments. If a start_time is given the program will only plot the position of the particles from start_time to end_time.
