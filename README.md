Instruction to run the code:

1: Make a folder and clone the repository 

2: In the made folder run 'cmake path/to/GroupG-Molekulardynamik'

2: In the made folder run 'make'

3: Execute the executable with: "Usage: ./MolSim <path/to/input/file> [[end_time delta_t] | [end_time delta_t start_time]]".

Please make sure to pass numerical values to end_time delta_t and start_time as a check is not yet implemented. Also pay attention to the order of the arguments. If a start_time is given the program will only plot the position of the particles from start_time to end_time.
